CSS -> first time using Tailwind

Some CSS-specific challenges:

- positioning content on top of (multiple) background svgs -> the workaround I chose was to position each div separately (e.g. -top-16) but would like to find a more scalable solution.

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.
